## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mamun

I'm a Frontend Developer with 5+ years of experience building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack**  
- **Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Svelte, SvelteKit  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Mapping Libraries:** Mapbox, OpenLayers, ArcGIS  
- **Charts & Visualization:** Chart.js  
- **Other Tools:** Git, Vercel, Netlify, Figma

ðŸ›  **What I'm working on**  
At my current company, Iâ€™ve contributed to two real estate B2B platformsâ€”one built with Svelte and the other with React. These apps involve heavy map features and component-driven UI, making me comfortable working with geospatial libraries and performance-focused interfaces.

ðŸ’¡ **What I love**  
Clean code, well-structured components, mobile-first design, and delivering fast, beautiful interfaces that scale.
